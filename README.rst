This is a port of the traSMARt documentation into the Sphinx system. The previous documents were in Word (and thus unsuitable for proper version control and difficult to collaborate over). This new version (with a plaintext format) will be more suitable and allow export to multiple formats.

The conversion from Word to reStructured text was done with automated tools and a whole bunch of regexes. So it's a bit rough and ready in places.
